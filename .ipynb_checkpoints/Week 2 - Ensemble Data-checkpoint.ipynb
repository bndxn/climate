    "**2. Working with ensemble data**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this you will need to download \"HadSST.4.0.0.0_ensemble.zip\" from https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst4/data/download.html it is a massive folder of 200 ensemble members! A useful tool for looking at netcdf files: Panoply (Nasa) https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Model ensembles are very common. They represent a group (anywhere between 2 and 100+) of *model runs* using similar initial conditions. The initial conditions are varied slightly for each run to mimic randomness within the earth system. \n",

    "1. Initialise any arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a for loop which loops through the files in the ensemble foler and loads each sst file and the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Within the for loop calculate the baseline, current climates and anomalies for each of the files\n",
    "uses formulas from last week \n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each type of climate: baselines, currents and anomalies, concatenate the arrays so you end up with three arrays of shape (200,36,72) (as you have 200 files, you will have 200 values for each grid point) \n",
    "data2 = pd.concat([year, anomaly], axis=1) # learned to concatenate two series into a df\n",
    "\n",
    "5. outside of the for loop calculate the anomaly mean (for each grid point)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now loop through all of the grid points and compare the distributions of the baseline compared to the currents - are they significantly different (i.e. is the global sst now significantly different from what it was during the baseline?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an anomaly array of shape (36,72) which represents current - baseline SST\n",
    "* a boolean array of shape (36,72) which represents whether there is a statistical significant difference between baseline and current\n",
    "So this is not straightforward, if you're finding it impossible then just use the answers for this bit and try to understand what each line is doing.\n",
